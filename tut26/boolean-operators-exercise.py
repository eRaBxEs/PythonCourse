Write a program that asks user 3 questions:

Ask the user:
1. Are you a student?
2. Do you have pets?
3. Do you smoke?

The program automatically decides whether a property that you've applied to rent is available to you.

It should print an appropriate response, like "Property available" or "Property unavailable"

The program applies these criteria:

If you 're a student, you can only rent the property if you don't have a pet and if you don't smoke.

If you 're not a student, you can rent the property if you smoke or have pets, but not if you
smoke and also have pets
